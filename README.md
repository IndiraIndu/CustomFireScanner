# ZapExt
In Agile development to ensure security for each sprint release, we need to perform multiple regression tests which will involve multiple rounds of security scans. Every time engaging a dedicated security analyst would be expensive. To assist developers, we come up with a customizable ZAP plugin. For the first time, it will be configured with all the test controls and policies that has to be tested in the application and will be shared as a .zap extension  with the developer team. Developers can import this plugin into ZAP application and initiate any number of scans for every sprint release.
